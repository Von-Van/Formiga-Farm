# Writes a new Farm version, and optionally a new Formiga Desktop release tag, into every place
# that names them, and refreshes Cargo.lock to match, so a release commit never misses one.
#
# The changelog stays a person's to write: this script only says when the new version has no
# section in CHANGELOG.md yet, which the release workflow needs for its notes. A new Desktop tag
# can bring new versions of the crates Farm shares with it; the README names the tag, so check it.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/set-version.sh <version> [<desktop tag>]   e.g. scripts/set-version.sh 0.1.1 v0.67.3
#   scripts/set-version.sh --check                     says whether every place agrees
#
# Tools used: cargo, perl, grep and sed.
