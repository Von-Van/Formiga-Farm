//! The design contract between Formiga Desktop and Formiga Farm.
//!
//! Formiga Desktop owns the living colony. Formiga Farm is a workshop for how its creatures look:
//! it can reshape one that already lives in the colony, or draw a new one for Desktop to welcome.
//! Farm never owns a creature. Desktop opens a session with a [`FarmSnapshot`], a narrow
//! projection of what Farm needs to draw and nothing more, and Farm answers with
//! [`FarmProposal`]s: a design, and what it is for. Desktop alone decides whether to keep one,
//! by [`accept_proposal`], and changes only the creature's appearance when it does.
//!
//! This crate is a draft kept beside Formiga Farm until Desktop adopts it, the way Formiga Home's
//! contract is kept beside Home. It is built on Desktop's own crates where they say the same
//! thing: a creature's look travels as the very [`formiga_travel::TravelAppearance`] a trip
//! carries, documents are written whole the same way, and text is made safe the same way. The
//! design itself is [`formiga_forms::Design`].
//!
//! # A session, file by file
//!
//! Everything for one session lives in one directory, named after its [`SessionId`]:
//!
//! | File | Written by | When |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`SNAPSHOT_FILE`] | Desktop | Before Farm is started. Never changed afterwards. |
//! | [`ACK_FILE`] | Farm | Once Farm has read the snapshot, saying whether it can open it. |
//! | [`PROPOSAL_FILE`] | Farm | Each time the owner applies a design, whole. Each has a serial one higher than the last; the newest written is the one that counts. |
//! | [`VERDICT_FILE`] | Desktop | When Desktop has decided on a proposal: kept, or why not. |
//! | [`RECALL_FILE`] | Desktop | If Desktop ends the session first. |
//!
//! Farm is started with two arguments, [`LAUNCH_ARGUMENT`] and the session directory's absolute
//! path, and with nothing else. Every file is written whole to a temporary name and then renamed
//! into place, so a reader sees an old file, a new file, or no file, never half of one.
//!
//! Desktop decides on a proposal while Farm is open, if it is watching, and otherwise when Farm
//! exits; either way it decides on each serial once. A creature is never handed over: it goes on
//! living on the desktop while Farm works on a copy of its design, and if anything goes wrong
//! (Farm missing, refusing, crashing, or writing something that does not check out) the creature
//! simply keeps the look it had.
//!
//! # Versions
//!
//! Every document carries its `format`, the `version` it was written as, and the
//! `min_reader_version` a reader must understand to use it, read exactly as `formiga-travel`
//! reads its own. The snapshot also names the design model version
//! ([`formiga_forms::DESIGN_VERSION`]) Desktop draws, and which sculpted plans it can keep.
//!
//! | Version | What it added |
//! |---|---|
//! | 1 | Everything |
//!
//! The golden fixtures under `tests/fixtures` are every version as it was first written, and must
//! keep reading.
